# cs326-final-hay
This is the final project for CS326 Web Development.

Rough description:
Website that centralizes online social games for students to hop into, probably some sort of friends list and then public / private key sharing for access to those game lobbies
* Horsepaste, amongus, skribble, town of salem, etc
* Lobby to keep track of wins / points across multiple games almost like a tournament / league style
* Integrate with discord??
* Some kind of interest system to show who wants to play a game (?)
