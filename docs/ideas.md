## **<div align="center">Innovative Idea**

HayStation is a website that feels like an arcade hub / centralized location for online gaming with friends and strangers alike. On this website, you would be able to find publicly posted lobby keys for various (likely free) games, while also having functionality for accounts to create private lobbies and invite users. A lobby in this case would act similar to a game league or tournament, where it keeps track of scores with a leaderboard. The idea of a web-based centralized game hub hasn't been popular in a while, with previous ones mostly being flash game hosting websites with forums. This is more similar to the role that Discord plays, in being a central server to gamers to connect on. However, unlike discord this is designed specifically for multiplayer game lobbies, and finding them / keeping score. It wouldn't make sense to reinvent the wheel for the community side of it though, and so integrating with the Discord API seems like a no-brainer.
Other feature's we're looking to explore: 

* School hubs for a larger .edu lobby that contains more lobbies. 
* May as well imbed our scrabble project into the website.

## **<div align="center">Important Components**

* Integration with Discord API to make lobbies and friends easier to manage.
* Integration with some game API's if available to provide automatic score keeping
* Way for players to express their interest in games, and to queue games for a lobby.
* The leaderboard will likely be manually updated, but potentially in the future automated.
* Lobbies will exist for a set duration (hour, day, week, month. Whatever)
* Leadeboards will be stored indefidently, providing access to users curious of a lobby result.
