Innovative Idea

The idea is for a website that is a kind of arcade hub / centralized location for online gaming with friends and strangers alike. On this website, you would be able to find publicly posted lobby keys for various (likely free) games, while also having functionality for accounts to create private lobbies and invite users. A lobby in this case would act similar to a game league or tournament, where it keeps track of points / wins (manually updated most likely) of each player, the lobby would exist for a set duration keeping a leaderboard, and then expire eventually being deleted. (Perhaps retaining the scoreboard for reference)
Other feature's we're looking to explore: 
* Integration with Discord API to make lobbies and friends easier to manage.
* Integration with some game API's if available to provide automatic score keeping
* Way for players to express their interest in games, and to queue games for a lobby.
* School hubs for a larger .edu lobby that contains more lobbies?? 
* May as well imbed our scrabble project into the website, cuz why not


// original written idea
Website that centralizes online social games for students to hop into, probably some sort of friends list and then public / private key sharing for access to those game lobbies
Horsepaste, amongus, skribble, town of salem, etc
Lobby to keep track of wins / points across multiple games almost like a tournament / league style
Integrate with discord??
Some kind of interest system to show who wants to play a game (?)
